The "public/assets/fonts" is a directory that should contain font files. As an AI text-based model, I can't generate binary font files. However, I can provide an example of how you might reference these fonts in your CSS:

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'CustomFont';
    src: url('/assets/fonts/CustomFont-Regular.ttf') format('truetype');
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
}
```

You would replace 'CustomFont' and 'CustomFont-Regular.ttf' with the actual name of your font and font file, respectively. This CSS can be included in your main.scss or any other .scss file.
