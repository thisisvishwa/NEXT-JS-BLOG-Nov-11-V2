As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to create actual image files. However, I can suggest the structure and naming conventions for the icons that should be placed in the `public/assets/icons` directory. 

Here's a list of suggested icon files that you might need for a tech blog website:

1. `home-icon.svg` - Icon for the home page link.
2. `article-icon.svg` - Icon for the article or blog posts.
3. `search-icon.svg` - Icon for the search functionality.
4. `user-icon.svg` - Icon for user profiles.
5. `dashboard-icon.svg` - Icon for the admin dashboard.
6. `content-management-icon.svg` - Icon for content management in the admin panel.
7. `user-management-icon.svg` - Icon for user management in the admin panel.
8. `analytics-icon.svg` - Icon for analytics in the admin panel.
9. `ad-management-icon.svg` - Icon for ad management in the admin panel.

Please note that these are just suggested names and you should replace these `.svg` files with actual icon images that suit your website's design and aesthetics.
